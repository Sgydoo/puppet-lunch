<h2>What's It All About?</h2>

<h3>About Puppet</h3>

<p><a href="http://puppetlabs.com">Puppet</a> provides system
   administrators with a really cool new way to manage multiple
   servers, and with the widespread acceptance of public and private
   cloud platforms such as Vmware vSphere, Amazon EC2, or Google
   Compute Engine, centralised management and provision of virtual
   servers has never been more important.</p>

<p>Managing an estate in this way allows IT Operations teams to adapt
   quickly to the needs of developers and business goals. It also
   provides a way to treat infrastructure as code, naturally bringing
   the world of Operations and Development closer together. In some
   circles, this New Way is known as 'DevOps'.</p>

<p>If you're interested in learning Puppet, there are many resources
   out there to help. Puppet Labs have clearly made a huge effort to
   produce <a href="http://docs.puppetlabs.com/">useful and coherent
   documentation</a>, which is supplemented by other sites such as the
   renowned <a href="http://www.puppetcookbook.com/">puppet
   cookbook</a>, not to mention numerous blog posts and articles by
   experienced Puppet users and prominent Puppet Labs employees.</p>

<h3>About The Author</h3>

<p>Your humble author is an IT Consultant by trade, specialising in
   Linux systems and Internet-facing services. While working on
   setting up a Puppet Enterprise system for one of my clients, I
   wanted to build a platform which incorporated modern Puppet best
   practices while retaining enough flexibility to cope with future
   changes. Only time will tell whether or not that goal has been
   achieved, but I found during the design phase that there were a lot
   of decisions to be made, and very few complete end-to-end examples;
   there's a lot of good information out there, but I had to stitch
   together many different concepts to make the whole thing work the
   way we wanted it to.</p>

<h3>About The Site</h3>

<p>This site serves as a record of that stitching process. It's
   currently work in progress (and I didn't begin with the intention
   of publishing, so please forgive any terrible stylistic
   inconsistencies and occasional dubious diagram), but I thought it
   may be helpful for others starting out on a similar journey to see
   the kind of decisions involved in setting up a useful configuration
   management platform.</p>

<p>Why "Puppet Lunch"? Well, I must admit to feeling a bit peckish
   when I came up with the name. And perhaps someone out there will
   find it pleasant to peruse the site for a little light lunchtime
   reading with their peanut butter sandwich.</p>

<p>I hope you find it at least a little bit helpful. If I've missed
   something obvious or Got It All Wrong, you're very welcome to get
   in touch, or submit a pull request on <a

<p>Happy reading!</p>
