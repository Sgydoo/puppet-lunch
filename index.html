<h2>Welcome to Puppet Lunch!</h2>

<p>This site is dedicated to the Puppet configuration management
   software, produced by Puppet Labs. It's not an official site -
   Puppet Labs have produced <a href="http://docs.puppetlabs.com/">excellent
   documentation</a> for their product and I'd encourage anyone
   learning Puppet to start their investigations there.</p>

<p>However, there are many aspects of setting up a Puppet system that
   the documentation does not cover, or it does so in passing without
   going into detail. In some cases it is incomplete and I've spent
   some time digging around for answers in an unexpectedly sparse
   landscape.</p>

<p>Whenever I've found the answers to these questions, I've jotted
   them down in the local wiki so neither I nor my colleagues need
   scour the Internets trying to find the answers again. In the same
   wiki I also chronicled the decisions made whilst designing the
   system, with the intention of creating an extremely flexible Puppet
   platform which adopts many of the latest best practices employed by
   the Puppet community.</p>

<p>After almost three months of investigations, the jottings became
   rather voluminous. I use them to remind me of stuff I found out
   weeks ago and had forgotten, and it occurred to me that someone,
   somewhere may find them useful too.</p>

<p>So I decided to make a home for them on the Interwebs! Yes, here
   they are in all their anonymised glory, for your perusal. And if
   you happen to stumble upon a page or two in a Google search result
   and find the information you're looking for, then this site will
   have fulfilled its purpose.</p>

<p>Please bear in mind that this is just one person's view, and should
   not be considered The Right Way To Do It. In my experience there
   is no such thing.</p>

<p>Anyway, that's enough waffle. Anyone for a spot of lunch?</p>

<p>P.S. The usual caveats apply - if you decide to follow any of the
        methods or advice contained within these pages, you do so at
        your own risk. I also have a nice shiny disclaimer <a
        href="{{ site.baseurl }}/disclaimer">here</a>.</p>
